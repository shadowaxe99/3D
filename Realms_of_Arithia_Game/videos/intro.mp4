As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as videos directly. However, I can provide you with an example of how you might reference the `intro.mp4` video file within an HTML file to be played as part of the game's introduction sequence.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Realms of Arithia - Intro</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <video id="intro-video" width="800" height="450" autoplay>
        <source src="videos/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <script src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="js/utils/constants.js"></script>
    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML snippet includes a video element that references the `intro.mp4` file. When this HTML page is loaded, the video will automatically play. Please note that this is a hypothetical example of how the video file might be included in the game's web structure, and the actual implementation may vary based on the game's design and requirements.
